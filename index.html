            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section id="introduction">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I come from a climate that is the complete opposite of a typical climate in Africa. Not humid, not
                    warm, but cold and dry. I come from the coldest north; I was raised in Sweden.</p>

                <p>I recently moved to Austria on the southern mountainside of Salzburg, where my mother had recently
                    moved. She lived in a small village with much tourism all year round. I very quickly got a job at
                    a newly opened restaurant looking for service staff.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>With the village located at almost 1km above sea level, the temperature was not much different from
                    Sweden. So, I was very much used to it, unlike my significant other: a woman from Tanzania whom I
                    met at a voluntary theater group in Salzburg. She had traveled to Austria to do her Masters in
                    Theater, and that is how we met; fate has brought us together. After almost half a year, in April of
                    2024, she took me to Africa.</p>

            <!-- Arrival in Africa -->
            <section id="arrival">
                <h2>Arrival in Africa</h2>
                <p>My girlfriend and I had traveled to meet my relatives in Germany prior to this trip. We had felt both
                    the excitement and tiredness of traveling together before, but this journey was very different. It
                    was both more exhausting yet also more empowering, giving both of us a lot of strength to endure
                    fatigue. We felt unconditionally stronger, which is to say the least, an amazing feeling.</p>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Flight overview to Tanzania</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Getting on the plane from Istanbul to Tanzania was special. I didn't expect such a large variety of
                    people entering that plane to visit Africa. I saw Americans interacting with each other and speaking
                    to foreigners in a kind manner, giving me a feeling of international importance. As someone who has
                    been to the States before, it was cool to see. So warm and eager for an adventure, just like me.
                </p>
                <p>Prior to this trip, I had never been to Africa before. Funny enough, I hadn't even applied for a visa
                    before traveling to Tanzania. Why? Because I had been told beforehand by relatives of my girlfriend
                    that there is "visa on arrival," which costs 50 US dollars and is easily attainable. So upon
                    arrival, this was now the real test, would I be stuck for hours on end, or make my way through
                    without any hassle? I made it to customs in a large single line of people; my girlfriend, a
                    Tanzanian, took the shortcut. I greeted the border patrol with "Shikamoo," a polite way of greeting
                    an older person, literally translated to "I touch your feet." They replied with "Marahaba," and I
                    responded with "Nzuri," meaning "I'm good." He asked me just one more question, "Why are you here?"
                    My brief answer, that I was traveling with my girlfriend, sufficed. I paid, and I was through. This
                    was a very pleasant experience, which lifted my spirits high. I had been afraid that I could be
                    stuck, but no, Tanzania welcomed me with open arms.</p>

            <!-- Cultural Differences and Similarities -->
            <section>
                <h2>Cultural Differences and Similarities</h2>
                <p>There are many differences between Europe and Africa. I can't stress this enough, but people are very
                    welcoming. I believe, for example, that there is more racism in Europe than in Africa, but you may
                    disagree. From my experience in Tanzania, I was treated with respect, mostly undeservedly, perhaps,
                    as I am just in my mid-thirties without any great achievements so far, only blessed with a girl who
                    accompanied me, so to speak.</p>
                <p>I was not your average tourist at all; I was invited into a family for a meet and greet party. I met
                    the parents of my loved one, her grandmother, her little brother, many of her cousins, aunties,
                    uncles, and some family friends. To my surprise, I was not the only one speaking German.</p>
                <p>In Tanzania, the sense of community is strong, and people are very welcoming to foreigners. However,
                    the love for family, good food, and the celebration of traditions is something both cultures share
                    deeply.</p>

                        <p>Tanzania, located in East Africa, is known for its diverse culture, rich history,
                            and natural beauty. The country gained independence from Britain in 1961. The capital city is
                            Dodoma,
                            while Dar es Salaam remains the largest city and main economic hub. The official languages are
                            Swahili
                            and English, and the currency is the Tanzanian shilling (TZS).</p>

            <section id="bagamoyo">
                <h2>A Town with a Grim History</h2>
                <p>Bagamoyo is where I spent most of my time in Tanzania and where I truly experienced Africa. Despite
                    the town's poverty, the people are incredibly friendly to foreigners.</p>

                <p>"Bwaga," meaning 'dump,' and "moyo," meaning 'heart,' was the place in history where slaves got to
                    rest after months of walking. Bagamoyo translates into 'lay down your heart' or something similar.
                </p>
                <p>Bagamoyo, a historic town in Tanzania, played a pivotal role in the East African slave trade during
                    the 18th and 19th centuries. The town's coral buildings, characteristic of Swahili construction,
                    served as a gathering point where slaves from the African interior were brought by native, Arab, and
                    Portuguese traders before being shipped to Zanzibar. Zanzibar, under Omani control by the mid-17th
                    century, became a major hub for supplying slave labor to local plantations and European colonies.
                    The architectural heritage of Bagamoyo reflects its diverse influences, including grand houses built
                    by wealthy Arabs and Indian merchants and the distinct styles introduced by German settlers in the
                    19th century. Today, the significance of Bagamoyo and the Central Slave and Ivory Trade Route is
                    recognized, with efforts underway to preserve its historic buildings and raise public awareness
                    about its past.</p>

                <h2>A Ride through the Town on a "Boda Boda"</h2>
                <p>Bagamoyo is where I spent most of my time in Tanzania and where I truly experienced Africa. Despite
                    the town's poverty, the people are incredibly friendly to foreigners. I was not your average tourist
                    at all; I was invited into a family for a meet and greet party. I met the parents of my loved one,

                    To my surprise, I was not the only one speaking German.</p>

                <p>Over the next few days, I got to experience local Bagamoyo. A family friend took us from place to
                    place on his "Boda Boda," which is what they call a motorcycle. It was a lot of fun. We visited many
                    places in Bagamoyo:</p>

                <h2>My Impressions of an African Fish Market</h2>
                <p>The fish market is a significant place. The variety of fish was large, and the quality was good. My
                    girlfriend and I went there with her mother to buy fish. The price for fish must be bargained, and
                    when her mother had bought the fish, she joked with us but with a serious tone, saying that they
                    charged her more because we were following her around like ducks and since I am white, they thought
                    we had more money.</p>

            <section id="daressalaam">
                <h2>My Impressions of the City Life</h2>
                <p>Dar Es Salaam, approximately one hour south of Bagamoyo, is a stark contrast to the quiet town of
                    Bagamoyo. As the economic capital of Tanzania, it is a hub of activity, with markets, businesses,
                    and many high-rise buildings, making it hard to find a house among the "forest of buildings." The
                    city's energy was contagious, and I enjoyed every moment exploring its many facets.</p>
                <p>When my girlfriend and I visited Dar es Salaam, we mostly skimmed through the city by car with a
                    driver. We visited family members who owned restaurants along the streets and a tailor shop where we
                    bought newly tailored clothes. At one point, we dined at a semi-fancy restaurant to get to know some
                    family members better. It was a pleasant experience that reinforced the welcoming feeling
                    established during the arrival meet and greet party.</p>
                <p>As we were driving, we occasionally ended up in traffic jams, as is common in any big city. It was
                    amusing to me that people would come up to our car (since the windows were often down due to the
                    humidity and our A/C didn't work, unsurprisingly) and try to sell us various items. They sold bags
                    of cashews and other nuts, handmade ribbons and bracelets, and whatnot. The prices were cheap, with
                    everything being around 1,000 to 2,000 Tanzanian Shillings per item. When I was in Tanzania, I felt
                    like a millionaire!</p>

                    <h3>GDP of Tanzania</h3>
                    <p>Tanzania is a country that makes a lot of money from things like selling food and making stuff.
                        In 2022, all the money Tanzania made together was about 75 billion dollars. This big number is
                        called GDP. Each year, Tanzania tries to make more money than the year before. In 2022, they
                        made a little more money than in 2021, about 4.5% more. This means Tanzania is growing and
                        getting richer. But, each person in Tanzania made about 1,025 dollars on average for the whole
                        year, that's about 85 dollars each month.</p>

                <h2>Means of Transportation</h2>
                <p>This blog wouldn't be complete without me mentioning the iconic means of transportation in this
                    beautiful country and navigating this beautiful country is an adventure in itself. So here goes my
                    list:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Dala-Dala</li>
                    <p>These are minibusses or vans used for public transportation within cities and towns. My
                        girlfriend told me they are called Dala-Dala because it translates to '500-500,' meaning they
                        cost 500 TZS to board. They are an affordable and popular way to travel, although mostly
                        crowded.</p>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    <li>Boda-Boda Taxi</li>
                    <p>My favorite way of transportation, along with the rest of the population, as it seems. I saw them
                        everywhere, almost never with a helmet. Costs around 1,000-2,000 TZS to get you anywhere.</p>

                    <li>Bajaj</li>
                    <p>I honestly didn't even consider taking one of these anywhere, but they are popular because you
                        see them everywhere. Many Indians live here in Dar Es Salaam, too, so this one is also called
                        tuk-tuks. Used for short distances in towns and cities. No idea what the cost is.</p>

                    <li>Dhows</li>
                    <p>I would have loved to try one of these beautiful, traditional boats along the Swahili coast. At
                        the time, the weather conditions didn't allow for it but this is one way for you to get to
                        Zanzibar if you want a more exciting travel experience. They also go between islands, as there
                        are a lot of them.

                <h2>Tourist Attractions</h2>
                <p>There is lots to see in Tanzania, which I did not see: truthfully, we did not have time. While I
                    experienced the local life of a regular citizen, although on vacation, I could have gone on safaris,
                    climbed the tallest mountains in Africa, or drank from a coconut on a beautiful island. There is so
                    much I have not told you about this country but which are worth saying and worth exploring.</p>
                <p>My bucket list for when I go back can be described as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serengeti National Park</li>
                    <p>One of the most famous wildlife reserves in the world, known for its annual Great Migration of
                        over 1.5 million wildebeest and hundreds of thousands of zebras and gazelles.</p>
                    <li>Mount Kilimanjaro</li>
                    <p>Africa's highest peak and the tallest free-standing mountain in the world.</p>
                    <li>Zanzibar City</li>
                    <p>The king of rock, Freddie Mercury, was born on the beautiful island of Zanzibar, right here in
                        Tanzania.</p>

            <!-- Why Visit Africa? -->
            <section>
                <h2>Why Visit Africa?</h2>
                <p>I honestly feel like people in Africa are waiting for tourists to come and visit. The attitude
                    towards foreigners is very, very different from Western countries. It's almost reversed, sadly, in a
                    way, because when Africans come to Europe they may be treated with disrespect and prejudices but it
                    is reversed when traveling to Africa. I know everyone is excited to go there: the food is cheap and
                    people are eager to help you, reaping the benefits of having helped you as a "rich" white man, so to
                    speak, in no bad way. I hope this stays the case because otherwise, the kind and beautiful place
                    that I have gotten to know, which is Africa, could become alien and discriminatory like some
                    Europeans have become, for one reason or another. But poverty is a challenge, as I have pointed out
                    with statistics in this article. So any help or charity is very appreciated. Respect goes two ways,
                    and there is so much to see in Africa which is fun and exciting to anyone, not just Westerners. It
                    is worth a shot a million times, you will not regret it, unless you really don't like adventures,
                    traveling, talking, being social, or any of the normal worldly things which some of us modern people
                    have become foreigners to. If you feel like that, and you'd like to break free: Africa is there for
                    you. A good place to learn to become human again, if you ask me. Really!</p>
