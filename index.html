                <p>I didn't think twice about going to Africa.</p>
                <p>I come from a climate that is the complete opposite of a typical climate in Africa.</p>
                <p>Not humid, nor warm, but cold and dry. <br> I come from the cold north; I was raised in Sweden.</p>

                <h3>Meeting my girlfriend</h3>
                <p>I recently moved to Austria on the southern mountainside of Salzburg, where my mother lives. She
                    lives in a small village with much tourism all year round. I very quickly got a job at
                    a newly opened restaurant looking for service staff.</p>

                    <figcaption>A view out of the restaurant on the mountains</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>With the village located at almost 1 km (0,6 mi) above sea level, the temperature was not much
                    different from
                    Sweden. So, I was very much used to it, unlike my significant other: a woman from Tanzania whom I
                    met at a voluntary theater group in Salzburg. She had traveled to Austria to do her Masters in
                    Theater, and that is how we met; fate has brought us together. After almost half a year, in April of
                    2024, she took me to Africa.</p>

            <section id="arrival" class="scroll">
                <h2>Arrival in Tanzania</h2>
                <p>My girlfriend and I had traveled to meet my relatives in Germany prior to this trip. We had felt both
                    the excitement and tiredness of traveling together before, but this journey was very different. It
                    was both more exhausting yet also more empowering, giving both of us a lot of strength to endure
                    fatigue. We felt unconditionally stronger, which is to say the least, an amazing feeling.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Getting on the plane from Istanbul to Tanzania was special. I didn't expect such a large variety of
                    people entering that plane to visit Africa. I saw Americans interacting with each other and speaking
                    to foreigners in a kind manner, giving me a feeling of international importance. As someone who has
                    been to the States before, it was cool to see. So warm and eager for an adventure, just like me.
                </p>
                <p>Prior to this trip, I had never been to Africa before. Funny enough, I hadn't even applied for a visa
                    before traveling to Tanzania. Why? Because I had been told beforehand by relatives of my girlfriend
                    that there is "visa on arrival," which costs 50 US dollars and is easily attainable. So upon
                    arrival, this was now the real test, would I be stuck for hours on end, or make my way through
                    without any hassle? I made it to customs in a large single line of people; my girlfriend, a
                    Tanzanian, took the shortcut. I greeted the border patrol with "Shikamoo," a polite way of greeting
                    an older person, literally translated to "I touch your feet." They replied with "Marahaba," and I
                    responded with "Nzuri," meaning "I'm good." He asked me just one more question, "Why are you here?"
                    My brief answer, that I was traveling with my girlfriend, sufficed. I paid, and I was through. This
                    was a very pleasant experience, which lifted my spirits high. I had been afraid that I could be
                    stuck, but no, Tanzania welcomed me with open arms.</p>

            <!-- Cultural Differences and Similarities -->
            <section id="culture" class="scroll">
                <h2>Cultural Differences and Similarities</h2>
                <p>Based on my experience, I believe there is generally less racism in Tanzania compared to Europe,
                    though opinions may vary. During my visit to Tanzania (I'm in my mid-twenties), I was treated with
                    unexpected respect despite not having any significant achievements which may result in me earning
                    it. This respectful treatment seemed to be based solely on my appearance as a young Western visitor,
                    accompanied by my girlfriend. It's important to note that this is just my personal observation and
                    may not reflect everyone's experience.</p>
                <p>I was not your average tourist at all; I was invited into a family for a meet and greet party. I met
                    the parents of my loved one, her grandmother, her little brother, many of her cousins, aunties,
                    uncles, and some family friends. To my surprise, I was not the only one speaking German.</p>
                <p>In Tanzania, the sense of community is strong, and people are very welcoming to foreigners. However,
                    the love for family, good food, and the celebration of traditions is something both cultures share
                    deeply.</p>

                    <p>Tanzania, located in East Africa, is known for its diverse culture, rich history,
                        and natural beauty. The country gained independence from Britain in 1961. The capital city is
                        Dodoma,
                        while Dar es Salaam remains the largest city and main economic hub. The official languages are
                        Swahili
                        and English, and the currency is the Tanzanian shilling (TZS).</p>

                <h2>A Town with a Grim History</h2>
                <p>Bagamoyo is where I spent most of my time in Tanzania and where I truly experienced Africa. Despite
                    the town's poverty, the people are incredibly friendly to foreigners.</p>

                <p>"Bwaga," meaning 'to dump,' and "moyo," meaning 'heart,' was the place in history where slaves got to
                    rest after months of walking. Bagamoyo can be translated into 'lay down' or 'take a load off your
                    heart'.
                </p>
                <p>I was truly fascinated by the town and so thankful and surprised that I, by pure accident or call it
                    fate, landed in this town I had no idea existed. In this blog, you can see some pictures I took:
                    The featured picture in the introduction to this blog is the old Arab tea house built during the
                    18th century in Bagamoyo. During the 18th century, Arabs made their living right here.

                    From the 1880s up until the end of the First World War, mainland Tanzania was a German colony, and
                    Bagamoyo served as the first <em>capital of German East Africa</em> until 1891, when Dar es Salaam
                    became the
                    new capital. After the First World War, the territory became a British mandate under the League of
                    Nations.</p>
                <p>The featured picture for this chapter is the old German Boma assisted by metal poles in a
                    way to keep it from falling apart. </p>

                <h2>A Ride through the Town on a "Boda Boda"</h2>
                <p>I got to experience local Bagamoyo during my stay. In Tanzania, a "boda boda" (a motorcycle) is a
                    common means of transportation, and you can call a driver to take you anywhere for an affordable
                    price. A family friend, who I understood to be a "boda boda" taxi driver, took us from place to
                    place, and it was a lot of fun.</p>

                    when her mother had bought the fish, she joked with us but with a serious tone, saying that they
                    charged her more than usual because we were following her around like ducks and since I am white,
                    they thought

                <p>Dar Es Salaam, approximately one hour south of Bagamoyo, is a stark contrast to the quiet town of
                    Bagamoyo. As the economic capital of Tanzania, it is a hub of activity, with markets, businesses,
                    and many high-rise buildings, making it hard to find a house among the "forest of buildings."</p>
                <p>When my girlfriend and I visited Dar es Salaam, we mostly skimmed through the city by car with a
                    driver. As we were driving, we occasionally ended up in traffic jams, as is common in any big city.
                    It was
                    amusing to me that people would come up to our car (since the windows were often down due to the
                    humidity and our A/C didn't work, unsurprisingly) and try to <em>sell</em> us various items. They
                    offered bags
                    of cashews and other nuts, handmade ribbons and bracelets, and whatnot. The prices were cheap, with
                    everything being around 1,000 to 10,000 Tanzanian Shillings per item.</p>

                    <h3>GDP of Tanzania</h3>
                    <p>Tanzania is a country that makes a lot of money from things like selling food and making stuff.
                        In 2022, all the money Tanzania made together was about 75 billion dollars. This big number is
                        called GDP. Each year, Tanzania tries to make more money than the year before. In 2022, they
                        made a little more money than in 2021, about 4.5% more. This means Tanzania is growing and
                        getting richer. But, on average, every person in Tanzania made about 1,025 dollars that whole
                        year (2022), that's about 85 dollars <em>each month</em>.</p>

                <h2>Why Visit Tanzania?</h2>
                <p>Based on my experience, the people of Tanzania seem to have an enthusiasm for welcoming visitors.
                    Their attitude towards tourists may be different from what is seen in some Western countries. It's
                    important to recognize that sometimes when Africans travel to Europe, they may encounter cultural
                    challenges. However, my experience in Tanzania was delightful and completely different.</p>
                <p>The locals
                    in Tanzania appear ready to assist visitors with generosity, sometimes assuming that foreigners have
                    greater financial means. This is not ill-intentioned, but rather stems from existing perceptions.
                    Tanzania is a beautiful country rich in culture and natural resources, and it is my hope that this
                    welcoming attitude will continue.</p>
                <p> It's true that poverty remains a significant challenge in
                    Tanzania, as shown by various statistics. However, development efforts and responsible tourism can
                    contribute to improving the lives of locals.</p>
                <p>Tanzania has many natural and cultural attractions that
                    can appeal to any visitor. I would recommend people who are interested in learning and broadening
                    their perspectives to visit this country. It's a unique opportunity to immerse oneself in a
                    different culture, see beautiful landscapes, and perhaps gain a new outlook on life.</p>
                <p> For those
                    seeking a closer connection with the natural world or wanting to learn more about different
                    cultures, Tanzania can be an excellent place to start that journey. I believe that the experience of
                    visiting Tanzania can be eye-opening and potentially life-changing.</p>
                <p>This translation captures the
                    nuanced and balanced perspective of the original Swahili text, highlighting the positive aspects of
                    visiting Tanzania while also acknowledging some of the challenges and cultural differences visitors
                    might encounter.</p>
