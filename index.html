            <p>My journey to Tanzania was nothing short of an adventure, offering a blend of rich history, vibrant
                culture, and bustling city life. This blog post aims to encapsulate my experiences in Bagamoyo, a town
                steeped in history, and Dar Es Salaam, the economic heart of Tanzania. As you explore this narrative,
                you'll also find various elements that demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS. From interactive forms to
                dynamic tables and multimedia content, this homepage is designed to showcase both the beauty of Tanzania
                and my technical proficiency.</p>

            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section id="introduction">
                <p>Prior to this trip, I had never been to Africa before. I come from the cold north, I was raised in
                    Sweden. I am used to the cold weathers and a lot of snow. I lived in a country for more than 20
                    years, where one half of the year is dark, and the other half of the year the sun is almost always
                    up.</p>
                <span>A typical morning in Sweden might look like this video here:</span>

                <p>I recently moved to Austria on the southern mountainside of Salzburg, where my mother had recently
                    moved. She lived in a small village with much tourism all year round. I very quickly got a job at
                    a newly opened restaurant looking for service staff.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>With the village located at 902 meters above sea level, the climate was in my experience not much
                    different from Sweden, although, not as terribly icy cold. So, I was very much used to it, unlike my
                    significant other: a woman I met at a voluntary theater group in Salzburg, called LaborX, which does
                    fun theater acting activities every Monday. She had traveled to Austria to do her Masters in
                    Theater, and this is where I met her. A couple of months into our relationship, it became an idea to
                    go visit her home country together. On the 13th of April, it was take off!</p>

                <p>My girlfriend and I had traveled from Salzburg to Germany prior to this trip to meet my relatives in
                    Frankfurt. We had felt the excitement and tiredness of traveling before, but this journey was very
                    different. It was more exhausting yet also more exhilarating, giving both of us a lot of strength to
                    endure fatigue with ease. It was an amazing feeling.</p>

                <p>Getting on the plane from Istanbul to Tanzania was special. I didn't expect such a large variety of
                    people entering that plane to visit Africa. I saw Americans interacting with each other and speaking
                    to foreigners in a kind manner, giving me a feeling of international importance. As someone who has
                    been to the States before, it was amazing to see. So warm and eager for an adventure, just like me.
                </p>
                <p>I hadn't applied for a visa before traveling to Tanzania. I had been told beforehand that there is
                    "visa on arrival," which costs 50 US dollars and is easily attainable. I made my way through
                    customs, greeting the border patrol with "Shikamoo," a polite way of greeting an older person,
                    literally translated to "I touch your feet." They replied with "Marahaba," and I responded with
                    "Nzuri," meaning "I'm good." Just one more question, "Why are you here?" My brief answer sufficed, I
                    paid, and I was through. It was a very pleasant experience, which lifted my spirits. I had been
                    afraid that I could be stuck, but no, Tanzania welcomed me with open arms.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 2: Exploring Bagamoyo</h2>
                <p>Bagamoyo is where I spent most of my time in Tanzania and where I truly experienced Africa. Despite
                    the town's poverty, the people are incredibly friendly to foreigners. I was not your average tourist
                    at all; I was invited into a family for a meet and greet party. I met the parents of my loved one,
                    her grandmother, her little brother, many of her cousins, aunties, uncles, and some family friends.
                    To my surprise, I was not the only one speaking German.</p>

                <p>Over the next few days, I got to experience local Bagamoyo. A family friend took us from place to
                    place on his "Boda Boda," which is what they call a motorcycle. It was a lot of fun. We visited many
                    places in Bagamoyo:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The beach</li>
                    <li>The fish market</li>
                    <li>The slave museum</li>
                    <li>Stone Town Road and various historical buildings</li>
                    <li>The Catholic mission building: The Holy Ghost Mission</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The fish market is a significant place. The variety of fish was large, and the quality was good. My
                    girlfriend and I went there with her mother to buy fish. The price for fish must be bargained, and
                    when her mother had bought the fish, she joked with us but with a serious tone, saying that they
                    charged her more because we were following her around like ducks and since I am white, they thought
                    we had more money.</p>

                    <h2>History of Bagamoyo</h2>
                    <p>Bagamoyo, a historic town in Tanzania, played a pivotal role in the East African slave trade
                        during the 18th and 19th centuries. The town's coral buildings, characteristic of Swahili
                        construction, served as a gathering point where slaves from the African interior were brought by
                        native, Arab, and Portuguese traders before being shipped to Zanzibar. Zanzibar, under Omani
                        control by the mid-17th century, became a major hub for supplying slave labor to local
                        plantations and European colonies. The architectural heritage of Bagamoyo reflects its diverse
                        influences, including grand houses built by wealthy Arabs and Indian merchants and the distinct
                        styles introduced by German settlers in the 19th century. Today, the significance of Bagamoyo
                        and the Central Slave and Ivory Trade Route is recognized, with efforts underway to preserve its
                        historic buildings and raise public awareness about its past.</p>
