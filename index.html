            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section id="introduction">
                <p>Prior to this trip, I had never been to Africa before. I come from the cold north, I was raised in
                    Sweden. I am used to the cold weathers and a lot of snow. I lived in a country for more than 20
                    years, where one half of the year is dark, and the other half of the year the sun is almost always
                    up.</p>

                <p>I recently moved to Austria on the southern mountainside of Salzburg, where my mother had recently
                    moved. She lived in a small village with much tourism all year round. I very quickly got a job at
                    a newly opened restaurant looking for service staff.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>With the village located at 902 meters above sea level, the climate was in my experience not much
                    different from Sweden, although, not as terribly icy cold. So, I was very much used to it, unlike my
                    significant other: a woman I met at a voluntary theater group in Salzburg, called LaborX, which does
                    fun theater acting activities every Monday. She had traveled to Austria to do her Masters in
                    Theater, and this is where I met her. A couple of months into our relationship, it became an idea to
                    go visit her home country together. On the 13th of April, it was take off!</p>

                <p>My girlfriend and I had traveled from Salzburg to Germany prior to this trip to meet my relatives in
                    Frankfurt. We had felt the excitement and tiredness of traveling before, but this journey was very
                    different. It was more exhausting yet also more exhilarating, giving both of us a lot of strength to
                    endure fatigue with ease. It was an amazing feeling.</p>

                <p>Getting on the plane from Istanbul to Tanzania was special. I didn't expect such a large variety of
                    people entering that plane to visit Africa. I saw Americans interacting with each other and speaking
                    to foreigners in a kind manner, giving me a feeling of international importance. As someone who has
                    been to the States before, it was amazing to see. So warm and eager for an adventure, just like me.
                </p>
                <p>I hadn't applied for a visa before traveling to Tanzania. I had been told beforehand that there is
                    "visa on arrival," which costs 50 US dollars and is easily attainable. I made my way through
                    customs, greeting the border patrol with "Shikamoo," a polite way of greeting an older person,
                    literally translated to "I touch your feet." They replied with "Marahaba," and I responded with
                    "Nzuri," meaning "I'm good." Just one more question, "Why are you here?" My brief answer sufficed, I
                    paid, and I was through. It was a very pleasant experience, which lifted my spirits. I had been
                    afraid that I could be stuck, but no, Tanzania welcomed me with open arms.</p>

                <p>Tanzania, located in East Africa, is known for its diverse culture, rich history, and natural beauty.
                    The country gained independence from Britain in 1961. The capital city is Dodoma, while Dar es
                    Salaam remains the largest city and main economic hub. The official languages are Swahili and
                    English, and the currency is the Tanzanian shilling (TZS).</p>

                <h2>Chapter 2: Exploring Bagamoyo</h2>
                <p>Bagamoyo is where I spent most of my time in Tanzania and where I truly experienced Africa. Despite
                    the town's poverty, the people are incredibly friendly to foreigners. I was not your average tourist
                    at all; I was invited into a family for a meet and greet party. I met the parents of my loved one,
                    her grandmother, her little brother, many of her cousins, aunties, uncles, and some family friends.
                    To my surprise, I was not the only one speaking German.</p>

                <p>Over the next few days, I got to experience local Bagamoyo. A family friend took us from place to
                    place on his "Boda Boda," which is what they call a motorcycle. It was a lot of fun. We visited many
                    places in Bagamoyo:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The beach</li>
                    <li>The fish market</li>
                    <li>The slave museum</li>
                    <li>Stone Town Road and various historical buildings</li>
                    <li>The Catholic mission building: The Holy Ghost Mission</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The fish market is a significant place. The variety of fish was large, and the quality was good. My
                    girlfriend and I went there with her mother to buy fish. The price for fish must be bargained, and
                    when her mother had bought the fish, she joked with us but with a serious tone, saying that they
                    charged her more because we were following her around like ducks and since I am white, they thought
                    we had more money.</p>

                    <h2>History of Bagamoyo</h2>
                    <p>Bagamoyo, a historic town in Tanzania, played a pivotal role in the East African slave trade
                        during the 18th and 19th centuries. The town's coral buildings, characteristic of Swahili
                        construction, served as a gathering point where slaves from the African interior were brought by
                        native, Arab, and Portuguese traders before being shipped to Zanzibar. Zanzibar, under Omani
                        control by the mid-17th century, became a major hub for supplying slave labor to local
                        plantations and European colonies. The architectural heritage of Bagamoyo reflects its diverse
                        influences, including grand houses built by wealthy Arabs and Indian merchants and the distinct
                        styles introduced by German settlers in the 19th century. Today, the significance of Bagamoyo
                        and the Central Slave and Ivory Trade Route is recognized, with efforts underway to preserve its
                        historic buildings and raise public awareness about its past.</p>

                <section id="daressalaam">
                    <h2>Chapter 3: The Economic Capital - Dar Es Salaam</h2>
                    <p>Dar Es Salaam, approximately one hour south of Bagamoyo, is a stark contrast to the quiet town of
                        Bagamoyo. As the economic capital of Tanzania, it is a hub of activity, with markets,
                        businesses, and many high-rise buildings, making it hard to find a house among the "forest of
                        buildings"</p>
                    <p>When my girlfriend and I visited Dar es Salaam, we mostly skimmed through the city by car with a
                        driver. We visited family members who owned restaurants along the streets and a tailor shop
                        where we bought newly tailored clothes. At one point, we dined at a semi-fancy restaurant to get
                        to know each other better. It was a pleasant experience that reinforced the welcoming feeling
                        established during the arrival meet and greet party.</p>
                    <p>As we were driving, we occasionally ended up in traffic jams, as is common in any big city. It
                        was amusing to me that people would come up to our car (since the windows were often down due to
                        the humidity and our A/C didn't work, not surprisingly) and sell various items. They sold
                        cashews, other nuts, and even handmade ribbons and bracelets. The prices were cheap, with
                        everything being around 1,000 to 2,000 Tanzanian Shillings per item. When I was in Tanzania, I
                        felt like a millionaire!</p>

                            <p>Tanzania's economy has witnessed a remarkable journey, with its nominal GDP soaring to
                                $75.71
                                billion USD in 2022. This impressive figure, reflecting the nation's resilience and
                                growth,
                                tells a story of persistent progress. Adjusted for inflation, the real GDP of $67.10
                                billion
                                USD underscores a tangible improvement in the country's economic health, despite global
                                challenges.<br>

                                The 4.56% GDP growth rate in 2022, a testament to Tanzania's vibrant economic
                                activities,
                                adds nearly $3 billion USD to the previous year's figure. This growth is not just a
                                number;
                                it represents new opportunities, hopes, and dreams for millions of Tanzanians.<br>

                                With a population of 65.5 million, growing at 3% annually, the nation is bustling with
                                potential. The GDP per capita, inching up to $1,025, signifies gradual progress in the
                                average Tanzanian's standard of living, though the journey towards widespread prosperity
                                continues.<br>

                                Reflecting on the past few decades, Tanzania's economic narrative is one of enduring
                                ambition and gradual success, moving from a modest $4.26 billion USD in 1993 to today's
                                robust economy. This growth speaks volumes about the nation's tenacity and the
                                unyielding
                                spirit of its people, striving for a brighter, more prosperous future.</p>

                <p>There is lots to see in Tanzania, which I did not see: truthfully, we did not have time. While I
                    experienced the local life of a regular citizen, although on vacation, I could have gone on safaris,
                    climbed the tallest mountains in Africa, or drank coconut on a beautiful island. There is so much I

                    take away the fun. But one last fun fact you probably didn't know: The king of rock, Freddie
                    Mercury, was born on the beautiful island of Zanzibar, right here in Tanzania. And yes, I did drink
                    from a coconut:</p>
