## Showcase Tanzania: A Personal Journey
This blog chronicles my unique experience in Tanzania, offering an intimate look at East African life through the eyes of a Swedish traveler invited into a local family. Unlike typical tourist accounts, this narrative provides a blend of personal observations and cultural insights. Key Features:

1. Firsthand experiences in Bagamoyo and Dar es Salaam
2. Insights into Tanzanian history, from its colonial past to present day
3. Insights into visa processes and local transportation
4. Cultural observations comparing European and African lifestyles
5. Personal anecdotes about family interactions and daily life in Tanzania

This blog aims to bridge cultures, fostering understanding and appreciation for Tanzania's heritage while providing valuable information for potential travelers. Whether you're planning an African adventure or simply curious about life in Tanzania, this blog offers a balanced perspective on the country's beauty, challenges, and potential for personal growth. Join me on this transformative journey and explore why Tanzania is not just a destination, but an experience that can broaden your horizons.

## UX

In this section, you will briefly explain your design processes.

### Colour Scheme

Explain your colours and the colour scheme.

Example: 


- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#E84610` used for primary highlights.
- `#4A4A4F` used for secondary text.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.

Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate


When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:
I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.
![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

### Typography

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example: 
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.
