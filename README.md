Showcase Tanzania is my personal travel experience in this East African nation. Unlike a typical tourist visit, I was invited to visit the family of my partner, a woman born and raised in Tanzania. Join me on my journey from Sweden to Austria and then to Tanzania, reflecting on my personal growth along the way. This is a true story, a travel blog of my life.

The blog aims to inform potential travelers about the attractions and experiences awaiting them in Tanzania. It provides an engaging and informative narrative, including factual information about Tanzaniaâ€™s history and economy.

By detailing my experiences and observations, particularly the cultural differences and similarities between Europe and Africa, this project helps to promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of Tanzanian culture.
